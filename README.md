PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Gender gap continues to be one of the most persistent issues in the field of technology, where women have been historically excluded. Several factors can be used to determine whether a gap between men and women exists in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. These include age, education, job title, country of residence and others. The purpose of this project is to highlight such factors using visualization and machine learning techniques, understand the causes that attribute to this gap, and more importantly, make recommendations towards closing it.

PROBLEM ELABORATION 
1. How do women compare to men in terms of age, education, country of residence, job title & programming experience? 
2. Does a pay gap exist between men and women? If yes, how has it changed? 
3. Is gender a primary determinant of a respondent’s compensation? 
4. What kind of machine learning models can be implemented to predict a respondent’s compensation? 

SCOPE
1. Shiny Application Dashboard
2. Feature Importance
3. Machine Learning Model Implementation
