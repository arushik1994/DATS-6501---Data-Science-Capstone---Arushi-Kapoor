# DATS-6501---Data-Science-Capstone---Arushi-Kapoor

**INTRODUCTION**

This is a multi-faceted Capstone project. It is a culmination of all the Data Science knowledge and skills gained while pursuing the Master of Science, Data Science program at The George Washington University. The purpose of this project is to use **Data Science for Social Good** and examine the representation of women in the field in depth. 

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Gender gap continues to be one of the most persistent issues in the field of technology, where women have been historically excluded. Several factors can be used to determine whether a gap between men and women exists in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. These include age, education, job title, country of residence and others. The purpose of this project is to highlight such factors using visualization and machine learning techniques, understand the causes that attribute to this gap, and more importantly, make recommendations towards closing it.

**PROBLEM ELABORATION**
1. How do women compare to men in terms of age, education, country of residence, job title & programming experience? 
2. Does a pay gap exist between men and women? If yes, how has it changed? 
3. Is gender a primary determinant of a respondent’s compensation? 
4. What kind of machine learning models can be implemented to predict a respondent’s compensation? 

**SCOPE**
1. [Shiny Application Dashboard](https://arushikapoor.shinyapps.io/DATS6501-ArushiK-Dashboard/)
2. Feature Importance
3. Machine Learning Model Implementation 

**DATA**

For visualization and application purposes, the data was obtained from Kaggle LLC's annual survey on Data Science and Machine Learning in 2019, 2020 and 2021. It was pre-processed and converted into a .rds format. For an ideal experience, RStudio must be used. 

For machine learning purposes, the data was obtained from Kaggle LLC's 2021 survey on Data Science and Machine Learning. It was read in a .csv format. Then, it was pre-processed, split into training and testing sets and modeled, using Jupyter Notebook.
